        <p style="margin-top: 12px; line-height: 1.5">
          Omega Gladius was an interesting beast, and my first team project. Our team leader decided they had
          wanted to build an autorunner-type game, although for the purpose of
          the class we needed to have additional gameplay elements as well. This
          led to an amalgamation of an action hack and slash, as well as a
          linear autorunner.
          <br />
          <br />
          My role in the project's creation consisted of coding the character
          controller, enemy behaviors, and various systems in the game. I also
          created the character sprite and it's animations, as well as the enemy
          sprite and accompanying combat effects. 
          
          <br><br>
          The project received a 4/5
          (above expectations) as it's team grade score, and I received a score
          of 5/5 on the game for individual contribution and academic
          excellence.

          For this project, I had switched to this team about halfway through
          the course. Their previous team member had widthdrawn from the course
          and I had offered to switch teams to help fill the gap. 
          <br>
          <br>
          The design
          lead's original game pitch was a fish-themed bullet hell where you
          could slow down time and maneuver underwater to dodge incoming swarms
          of bullets and enemies. This project was especially difficult as I had
          fallen ill with COVID-19 during production, putting me out for a
          third of the production process. Regardless, in the final 7 days of
          the course, I was able to take my team member's rough pseudo-code and high concepts and
          translate it all into C# as well as prepared visual assets and
          animations for the game ahead of the deadline.

        <h3>Shattered Soul - Technical/Gameplay Designer</h3>
        <h4>Atmospheric Platformer (DigiPen GAM200 Team Project)</h4>
        <div class="video_content">
          <video autoplay="true" loop="true" muted="true">
            <source src="images/shattered_soul.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
          </video>
        </div>
        <h3>Project Details:</h3>
        <p style="margin-top: 12px; line-height: 1.5">
          Shattered Soul is an
          atmospheric platformer with an emphasis on collectibles and level
          exploration. It was originally designed as a puzzle game but development pivoted halfway through the course to a simpler format. We quickly decided to forego any development on the puzzle half of the game and focus on platforming and exploration.
          <br />
          <br />
          As the gameplay designer, my job was to take the high concept (Puzzle platformer, turned "exploration" platformer)
          into a workable and playable idea we could execute on. Working with the rest of the team, I shifted our creative
          focus towards ways we could make this a unique experience. My solution became a mechanic that would
          have a distinctive effect on aspects of our game like player motivation and the conventional "health" system.
          <br>
          <br>
          The mechanics of the game revolve around this "Darkness" and "Saturation" system. As the player explores the world,
          a radius of encroaching darkness descends upon them. This effectively acts as a timer, prompting the player to move
          and explore the world with some degree of exertion; this wasn't a game a player could sit around and do nothing in.
          To fight off the inevitable death timer, players would have to search for and collect "souls", collectibles that fought
          back the darkness and gave the player more time to find the level's exit. At the junction between different sections of the level,
          the player would pass through "checkpoint" areas that would calculate how many souls had been collected and affect the "saturation"
          of the world around them depending on the extent they went to collect them. If the player collected a certain amount of souls, the
          world would become brighter and more colorful, conversely, if the player didn't collect enough, the world would become more bland
          and unappealing, signifying progress towards either extreme.
          <br>
          <br>
          Aside from designing the core mechanics of the game, I was also solely in charge of most of the programming. My main focus was the
          character controller; I wanted to make sure our character was fun and interesting to control in these vast spaces meant for expedient
          exploration, something which I was greatly praised for during testing and production of the game.
          <br>
          <br>
          The project received a 4.25/5, receiving bonus points for "Core Gameplay".
