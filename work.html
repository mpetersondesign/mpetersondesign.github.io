        <p style="margin-top: 12px; line-height: 1.5">
          Omega Gladius was an interesting beast, and my first team project. I
          had opted not to be the design lead for this project despite my team
          nominating me for it because I wanted to take a backseat and build
          someone else's game for a change. Our team leader decided they had
          wanted to build an autorunner-type game, although for the purpose of
          the class we needed to have additional gameplay elements as well. This
          led to an amalgamation of an action hack and slash, as well as a
          linear autorunner.
          <br />
          <br />
          My role in the project's creation consisted of coding the character
          controller, enemy behaviors, and various systems in the game. I also
          created the character sprite and it's animations, as well as the enemy
          sprite and accompanying combat effects. The project received a 4/5
          (above expectations) as it's team grade score, and I received a score
          of 5/5 on the game for individual contribution and academic
          excellence.

          For this project, I had switched to this team about halfway through
          the course. Their previous team member had widthdrawn from the course
          and I had offered to switch teams to help fill the gap. The design
          lead's original game pitch was a fish-themed bullet hell where you
          could slow down time and maneuver underwater to dodge incoming swarms
          of bullets and enemies. This project was especially difficult as I had
          gotten sick with COVID-19 during production, putting me out for a
          third of the production process. Regardless, in the final 7 days of
          the course, I was able to take my team member's rough pseudo-code and
          translate it all into C# as well as prepared visual assets and
          animations for the game ahead of the deadline.

          This project is currently in-progress. Shattered Soul is an
          atmospheric platformer with an emphasis on collectibles and level
          exploration. We're hoping to have it on mobile platforms as well as on
          a digital storefront by the end of GAM250.

          A lot of my contributions to this project have been in the character
          controller. Player movement is a huge part of what makes our game
          enjoyable, and making sure a user has fun while controlling their
          character is a huge part of my job. I also do most of the programming,
          and handling the technical side of Unity.
