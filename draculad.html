        <h3>Project Overview:</h3>
        <p>
          Mini Jam #118 is a game jam where designers must abide by a 3 day time
          limit given a theme and a unique "limitation" that the game must
          follow. Teams must find a way to make the theme and limitation work
          together in some form during gameplay. The theme for Mini Jam #118 was
          "vampire", while the limitation was "blood must be lethal". My team
          consisted of myself, an artist, and a sound designer.

        <h3>My Role:</h3>
        <p>
          I was the sole programmer and lead UX designer for the project. I
          scripted the game from scratch, was the sole contributor in-editor,
          and made various and necessary tweaks to the systems of the game
          according to UX design. Since this game jam was a time crunch, that
          meant establishing a quick and efficient feedback loop between
          playtests and work in-engine to deliver as polished of a product as
          possible given the time frame.

        <h3>Project Hurdles:</h3>
        <p>
          The first major problem we encountered was scope; our initial design
          for the game was much more grand than our allotted time period
          allowed, and although my team's game ideas were great, I was solely
          responsible for being the one to cut the project down to a manageable
          size for this submission. My teammates had spend a sizeable chunk of
          their time working on assets that were never used, while all of my
          time had to go into completely refactoring our core gameplay concepts
          into what was basically a bite-sized chunk of what we had designed
          for.

        <h3>Project Reception:</h3>
        <p>
          Mini Jam #118 had a 5 day judging period where the game was given
          ratings by game jam officials and the community that had submitted
          projects. Out of the 150 submissions made by other game jam entrants,
          Draculad placed #9 in overall score, landing the submission in the top
          10 for the jam.
