          Castle Climber is a small, 2-5 minute experience made for my technical
          design class in my senior year at DigiPen.

        <h3>Project Overview:</h3>
        <p>
          DES350 is, for all intensive purposes, a demonstrative project class.
          We had no prompt, other than "make a game", and so I created Castle
          Climber.
          <br /><br />
          Castle Climber is a momentum-based "parkour" physics platformer that
          pays homage to some of my favorite platforming movement options
          (diving and sliding). For Project 1 of this class, I wanted to create
          a fast, momentum-based movement system for my character controller,
          and thus the idea of a speed-based time trial.
          <br /><br />
          Castle Climber starts the player off in a small tutorial area, teaches
          them the controls, then shows a brief cutscene showcasing the threat
          and the level, and sets the player loose to complete the stage as
          quickly as possible. The main obstacles are the lava and the
          platforming challenges themselves; the level is specifically laid out
          so that skilled players can take a quicker, more direct route when
          utilizing better timed movement, while those who are unconfident or
          fail at these routes fall to a much slower path to the finish, putting
          them at risk of failure.

        <h3>My Role:</h3>
        <p>
          These were solo projects, so I had to do everything from the art to
          the programming. Everything was done in Unity and Photoshop over the
          course of two weeks.

        <h3>Project Hurdles:</h3>
        <p>
          I did not have as much time to work on this as I thought; sandwiched
          between other project-based classes, I really only had about a week
          and a half to two weeks out of the six weeks allotted to work on this
          project. I would say 90% of the in-engine implementation took place in
          the last 48 hours before the submission, but I am very proud of how
          this project turned out despite me not having as much time to focus on
          it as I would have liked.

        <h3>Project Reception:</h3>
        <p>
          The project received a 5/5 in Controls and Camera, 5/5 in Gameplay
          Systems, 4/5 in UI and UX, and 4/5 in Overall Execution.
